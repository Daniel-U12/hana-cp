# hana-cp

This is the repository of a brief project exploring the development of a basic Node.js application in SAP Cloud Platform. This project was built using SAP's Web IDE Full-Stack to build a HANA application using HANA as a Service. More details about this project can be found on the blog I wrote comparing the differences between developing on an on-premise version of hana and SAP Cloud Platform.
